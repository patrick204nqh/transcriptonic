## What it does

Meet Transcripts runs in the background during Google Meet calls. It reads the live captions and assembles a transcript locally in the browser. At the end of each meeting:

- Downloads the transcript as a `.txt` file
- Optionally POSTs it to a configured webhook (Google Docs, Notion, or any HTTP endpoint)

All processing stays in the browser. Nothing leaves the device unless you explicitly configure a webhook.

## Usage

The extension has two modes:

- **Auto mode** — records transcripts for every meeting automatically
- **Manual mode** — toggle capture on and off during each meeting via the extension popup

At the end of a meeting the transcript is downloaded as a `.txt` file. Open the extension popup to view the last 10 meetings or configure a webhook.

## Webhook integration

Pipe transcripts to any tool that accepts a webhook POST. Configure the URL in the extension's webhooks page (`meetings.html`). Supports both a simple pre-formatted body and a raw advanced body for code integrations.
