## What it does

meet-transcripts runs in the background during Google Meet calls. It reads the live captions and assembles a transcript locally in the browser. At the end of each meeting:

- Downloads the transcript as a `.txt` file
- Optionally POSTs it to a configured webhook (Google Docs, Notion, or any HTTP endpoint)

All processing stays in the browser. Nothing leaves the device unless you explicitly configure a webhook.
