## Merge review checklist

When reviewing an upstream sync PR, verify that upstream changes do not
silently overwrite items in **Active customizations**.

- [ ] `.github/workflows/upstream-sync.yml` is not touched by upstream
- [ ] Any replaced analytics/telemetry endpoints (if customized) are restored
- [ ] Any replaced status check endpoint (if customized) is restored
- [ ] Branding changes (if applied) are preserved
- [ ] Extension version in `manifest.json` is updated to latest upstream value
